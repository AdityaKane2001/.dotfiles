# My .dotfiles
I started off [Steven's .dotfiles](https://github.com/stevenwalton/.dotfiles), and changed these as I went.
After almost two years, it became really cluttered, so I cleaned up and reset the commit history since that just
had way too many dependencies cloned into it, but not as submodules.

Anyways, when I'm done with this, it should work on all my setups.

## Install
Simply run:
```
./install.sh
```
and it should take care of the rest according to the system.
